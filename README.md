c3p0 is the most widely used library for database connection pooling by Java applications. If the application code does not close the connection, it results in a connection leak. Identifying this leak can be quite challenging. With some additional bookkeeping of these connections, it should be relatively simple to identify the root cause. This project attempts to do that using Javaassist and Btrace.
